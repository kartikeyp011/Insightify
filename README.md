## 🏗️ Architecture

1. 🆙 Upload

   * Upload `.pdf` or `.txt` file via the frontend
   * PyMuPDF extracts text → LangChain chunks text

2. 🔎 Embedding + Indexing

   * Chunks embedded using Gemini 2.5 Embedding API
   * Indexed using FAISS (saved locally)

3. 📄 Summarization

   * Entire document summarized using Gemini 2.5 Pro
   * Summary saved and displayed on frontend

4. ❓ Ask Anything

   * User question + top FAISS chunks → passed to Gemini
   * Gemini answers in document context

5. 🧠 Challenge Me

   * Gemini generates 3 logic-based questions
   * User answers are scored, compared with ideal answers
   * Gemini provides explanation and score (1–5)

## 📫 Postman Collection (API Testing)

A complete Postman collection is included for testing all API endpoints.

📁 Location:
postman/Insightify.postman\_collection.json

This includes:

* POST /api/upload — upload .pdf/.txt
* POST /api/ask — ask a question
* GET /api/challenge — generate logic-based questions
* POST /api/evaluate — evaluate your answers

---

## 🔮 Prompt Engineering Examples

Sample prompt used to generate logic questions:

🧠 generate\_logic\_questions()

You are a university professor evaluating a research paper. Based on the provided context, generate 3 logic-heavy, reasoning-based questions that test whether a student has deeply understood the arguments and implications of the text. Avoid fact-based or simple summary questions. Number them 1., 2., and 3.

Sample prompt for evaluation:

📝 evaluate\_user\_answers()

You are an examiner. Compare the following student answers with ideal responses. For each one:

* Return the original question
* Include the user's answer
* Generate the ideal answer based on the document context
* Score out of 5 based on logic, relevance, and accuracy
* Add a short feedback comment

---

## 🧪 Sample Usage

1. Launch Streamlit UI
2. Upload any PDF/TXT (e.g., paper, report, short story)
3. Review auto-generated summary
4. Use:
