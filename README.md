## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Insightify uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline powered by a large language model (LLM), such as Gemini, to extract context from the uploaded document and generate intelligent outputs.

Flowchart:

1. Upload PDF/TXT →
2. Extract Text →
3. Chunk + Embed →
4. Store in FAISS →
5. Use LLM for:

   * Summary
   * Q\&A (Ask Anything)
   * Logic Question Generation & Evaluation (Challenge Me)

## 🧠 Prompt Engineering (Behind-the-Scenes)

Insightify uses the following prompt patterns:

For Q\&A:

> “Given this question and the following document content, answer truthfully and include reference to where it is found in the document…”

For Challenge Generation:

> “From this document, generate three comprehension or logic-based questions that require reasoning…”

For Evaluation:

> “Evaluate the following answer based on the original content. Is it correct? If not, explain why with reference…”
