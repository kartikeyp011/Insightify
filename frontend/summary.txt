In the sterile, emotionless city of Veridia, an archivist named Elara discovers a portal to Aethelgard, a magical world powered by stories. She learns that Veridia’s leader, the Architect, is maintaining his city’s perfect order by siphoning the life from Aethelgard, causing a decay known as “the Fading.”

Elara, an anomaly whose suppressed emotions can physically influence Aethelgard, realizes her world is a parasite. Rather than fight the enemy directly, she returns to Veridia and uses the energy conduit draining Aethelgard to reverse its flow. She floods her home with Aethelgard’s overwhelming stories, emotions, and chaotic beauty.

The act shatters Veridia’s repressive control, forcing its people to embrace feeling. By infecting her world with stories instead of fighting it, Elara saves Aethelgard and forges a new, symbiotic balance between logic and magic, ensuring the survival of both worlds.
